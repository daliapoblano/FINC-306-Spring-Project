# FINC-306-Spring-Project
Spring Project for my Stat and Math for Data Science Course

My project focuses on Global Average Temperature Analysis. Through a series of linear regression analysis as well as other calculations, I was able to determine that there is a significant increase in global average temperature since the year 1950.
